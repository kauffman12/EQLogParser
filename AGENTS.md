# Project Rules & Guidelines

You are an expert AI assistant tasked with maintaining this C#/WPF/.net 10.0 project.

## Core Principles
- **Follow Coding Standards** read and follow the standards under docs/CodingStandards.md
- **File structure**: Prefer small files and atomic commits.
- **Git**: Commit with detailed messages, but **never push to remote**. Pushing is the user's call.
- **Searching**: All files are under the current directoy. 
- **Do not** add heavy dependencies without explicit user approval.

## Testing Guidelines
- **Always** run `dotnet build` after completing work
- **FCT vocabulary is closed**: two region schemes (`Bands` = the panel's *fountain*, `ByType` = *split*) and four motion styles
  (`Freeze`, `Fountain`, `Spray`, `Arc`) plus `Straight`, which is arc's rail with the bend taken out. Halves, pulse, the cell grid and the
  stream were deleted on measurement, not parked: do not resurrect one because a comment mentions it. A new scheme or style arrives with a
  settings word, a panel entry, and tests — the shape names saved in `settings.ini` are exactly the words the dropdown shows (`arc`, `line`,
  `spray`, `freeze`; `Straight` excepted, saved as `line`).
- **FCT engine tests**: the dials are process globals (`FctScale.Text/Crit/Time`, `FctLayout.LabelSide`). Test classes in
  `EQLogParser.Test/src/control/fct` reset them through `FctAmbient.Reset()` via `[TestInitialize]`, and both test assemblies declare
  `[assembly: DoNotParallelize]`. Anything new that touches that engine must keep both, or state from one test leaks into another
  (a leaked speed dial was measured moving a row's spine 74 px — a real assertion failing on a machine that ran the same code).
- **UI-thread instrumentation**: "the numbers froze for a second" is answered by `UiBeatMonitor` (app) over `PerfCounters`/`PerfGc`/
  `PerfJournal` (`EQLogParser.Core/src/perf`), and every instrumented span is listed in docs/DesignNotes.md → "Instrumenting the UI
  thread". A span takes its handle from one `Register` call in a field initializer (no name lookups, no locks in frame paths) and closes
  in a `finally`: a pass left marked running by an exception keeps naming itself in every later stall line. `UiBeatMonitorTest` pumps a
  real dispatcher with short thresholds and relies on `[assembly: DoNotParallelize]` like the notes above, and the priorities it queues at
  are load-bearing — beats go out at `Render` (WPF's 7), so a test's pump check belongs between that and the work under test, never at
  `Normal` (9), or it wins the race against the late beat and the stall goes unmeasured. Numbers and reasoning: docs/DesignNotes.md.
- **`EQLogParser.Wpf.Test` runs MTA**: MSTest hands a test method an MTA thread, and WPF will not construct a `FrameworkElement` on one —
  its constructor asks that thread for its `InputManager` and throws before any of our code runs. So any test that news up a `UIElement`
  (`FctSkiaCanvas`, a window, a control) goes through `Sta.Run(...)` (`EQLogParser.Wpf.Test/src/Sta.cs`), which claims a thread as STA, runs
  the body there and rethrows at the call site so a failure still reads as a failed assertion. `Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher` does not help;
  it hands out a dispatcher on any thread and fails in the same constructor. The lane guide test found this by failing three for three.
- **Namespaces**: the WPF app compiles every source into the flat `namespace EQLogParser` whatever folder it lives in, while
  `EQLogParser.Core` matches folders (`EQLogParser.perf`). Tests reach app internals through `using EQLogParser;` (`InternalsVisibleTo` is
  already granted to both test assemblies); declaring `EQLogParser.ui.perf` in a new app file breaks that.
- **Timer bars: the lifecycle rules live in Core.** A countdown's length comes from the config box or a `TS:` capture (`DateUtil.SimpleTimeToSeconds`,
  which answers in *uint* seconds), so it reaches the app unbounded; durations go through `TimerLifecycle.ClampDuration` at creation and every stamp/delay
  through that class, because an unclamped value saturates `Task.Delay`'s int-ms cast (measured: a 24.8-day sleep for the task whose only job is removing
  the bar) or wraps `EndTicks` into the past. `EQLogParser.Test/src/util/TimerLifecycleTest.cs` sweeps the real parser's output range and asserts every row
  is ever removable — keep that green rather than moving the math back into `TimerOverlayWindow`. `trig.timerLateAdd` (rows refused because their stop
  arrived first — Start/Stop are fire-and-forget on the same semaphore, so `AcceptsRow` must stay) and `trig.timerStale` (rows the overlay reaped for
  itself) both count zero when healthy. A row with **no length** is refused too (`AcceptsRow` takes `durationTicks`): `DateUtil.FormatTicks` prints `00:00` for
  zero *and* for every negative value, and show-reset mode draws its cooldown text straight from `DurationTicks`, so an empty duration field is a greyed `00:00`
  that never leaves — that is what "a timer appeared at 0:00" was. Reasoning: docs/DesignNotes.md → "Timer overlays: how a bar gets taken away".
- **`EQLogParser.Wpf.Test`** is the Windows-only assembly (WPF and Skia surfaces, `EnableWindowsTargeting`): it builds everywhere but its
  tests need Windows to run, so `dotnet test` on the other assembly says nothing about it. Build it explicitly when touching app UI code.
- **Releases**: when touching `sign.cmd` or `EQLogParserInstall/*.iss`, read `docs/ReleaseChecklist.md`

## Post-Implementation Checklist
After completing work, verify:
- **Method visibility ordering**: public → internal → private (per CodingStandards.md)
- **Pattern matching**: use `is not T` / `is T var` instead of `as T` + null check (per CodingStandards.md)
- **Unused usings**: no leftover or unnecessary `using` statements

## Agent Behavior
- **Ask for Clarification**: If a feature requirement is ambiguous, ask before implementing.
- **Read the Syncfusion PDF files**: If there's a question about Syncfusion APIs look under syncfusion-wpf for info.
- **Never Use Claude/Anthropic Models**: Never use Claude or any other Anthropic model/provider for anything — no Claude Code, no Anthropic LLMs, no Anthropic VLMs.
- **Vision / Image Inspection**: Handle vision requests with `read` (native vision) and local tools only. Never call external or remote VLM services (e.g., `inspect_image`).

## Important: Never Touch
- `BackupUtil`
- `MaterialDarkCustom`
