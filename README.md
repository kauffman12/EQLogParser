# EQLogParser
Everquest Log Parser for Live/TLP servers.

Latest Release:
https://github.com/kauffman12/EQLogParser/raw/master/Release/EQLogParser-1.8.79.msi

This software depends on a Docking UI control from Actipro so it needs a license to build
and run without having an Actipro splash screen. However, I am currently replacing
Actipro with an equivlent from Syncfusion. Licenses for Syncfusion can be obtained
for free if you meet requirements. 

The Releases folder has recent builds including a version 1.9. build that's a work in-progress. The msi installer has been signed with a real cert. It still will display Unknown Publisher messages in windows but if you do the following you can avoid those in the future.

1. right-click the msi file and choose properties
2. under the digital signatures tab select the one signature and click details
3. click View Certificate
4. click Install Certificate
