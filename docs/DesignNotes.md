# EQLogParser Design Notes

Behaviour that is deliberate but not obvious from the code, and the rules that keep it that way.
Read the relevant section before changing import, sharing or migration code so decisions are not
quietly reversed. Style rules live in [CodingStandards.md](CodingStandards.md); this file answers
*"why is it like this?"* and *"what must not change without a decision?"*.

## Trigger and Overlay Import

"Import" means taking an `ExportTriggerNode` tree from some producer and merging it into the tree
stored by `TriggerStateDB`. The producers differ in transport and — importantly — in what identity
the payload carries:

| Producer | Wire form | Network | Identity carried by the payload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| File import `*.tgf.gz` (triggers) | gzip JSON `List<ExportTriggerNode>` | no | none |
| File import `*.ogf.gz` (overlays) | same | no | overlay leaves carry their EQLP `Id` |
| File import `*.gtp` | GINA file export: zip containing XML | no | none — **triggers only** |
| Quick Share `{EQLPT:key}` / `{EQLPO:key}` | key in an EQ chat line; payload fetched by key from the share host (`TriggerUtil.RunQuickShareTaskAsync`) | yes | same as the file exports |
| GINA share `{GINA:key}` | SOAP `DownloadPackageChunk`, up to 100 sequential chunks (`GinaUtil.RunGinaTaskAsync`) | yes | none — **triggers only** |
| NAG migration | local JSON chosen through the NAG directory picker | no | triggers: `OriginalId = nagTriggerId`; overlays: `OverlayData.Source = "nag:{overlayId}"` and **no Id** |

### The overlay tree is flat, the trigger tree is not

- Triggers live under the `Triggers` root, may contain folders, and are enabled per character.
- Overlays live under a single `Overlays` root as a **flat list**. Nothing in the product can create an
  overlay folder: the overlay context menu (`TriggersTreeView.xaml`) has no **Folder** command, and
  drag-and-drop refuses nesting for both trees (`ItemDropping` rejects `DropAsChild` unless the target
  `IsDir()`). The exporter therefore only ever writes overlay leaves directly under the root.
- Consequences to respect:
  - `ImportOverlays` always merges into the `Overlays` root, whatever was selected — the parent picked
    in the file dialog is used for triggers only.
  - Do not add folder-merge semantics, or features that assume grouping, to the overlay tree. Real
    grouping would need a product decision plus a data-model change and migration — not a patch in the
    import branch.
  - Overlays have no per-character enabled state: `ImportOverlays` passes no character ids, so nothing
    is written to `TriggerState.Enabled` for an overlay. Only triggers are enabled per character.

### Identity: what counts as "the same node" on re-import

This is the core contract of importing. Matching lives in `TriggerImportPlanner` (triggers) and in the
overlay branch of `TriggerStateDB.Import`.

**Triggers**
1. If the payload carries `OriginalId` (NAG), match on that. When more than one stored sibling — or
   more than one member of the incoming batch — shares the id, the family is disambiguated by `Name`,
   because one NAG trigger can expand into several siblings (phrase + timer variants, counter resets).
2. Otherwise match on `Name`.

`OriginalId` exists because NAG allows duplicate trigger names and the importer renames collisions
(`X` → `X (2)`), so name alone would break re-import and pile up duplicates. Trigger payloads carry no
node ids, so ids are never a trigger match key.

**Overlays — `Id` if present, `Source` only when there is no `Id`, never the name**
1. Match the sibling with the same EQLP `Id`.
2. If the payload has no `Id`, and `OverlayData.Source` is non-empty, match the sibling with that
   `Source`.
3. Otherwise insert a new overlay.

Rationale:
- The exporter writes `Id` only for overlay leaves, so `Id` is the only handle an EQLP→EQLP share or
  `.ogf.gz` file can offer, and it identifies content exactly. Checking it first is correct.
- `Source` is **not** a cross-user identity. NAG mints overlay ids as random 16-character nanoids per
  install, so `nag:{id}` values are only comparable within one person's own lineage. Its whole purpose
  is that re-running the NAG migration on the same install refreshes the overlays it created earlier
  instead of adding a second copy — which works precisely because NAG payloads carry no `Id`.
- Never match overlays by name. NAG's setup wizard creates overlays named things like *Detrimental
  Timers* and *Beneficial Timers*, so two players' same-named overlays are unrelated; a name match
  would silently overwrite someone else's work.
- On a `Source` match the stored overlay is also **renamed** to the incoming name, so content and name
  follow the latest migration. That is reachable only when no `Id` was supplied — i.e. NAG payloads —
  which is why it cannot clobber a shared overlay's local name.
- Accepted consequence: if one person migrates the same NAG database on two machines and then shares
  an overlay between them, they get one extra copy to delete. Do not "fix" this by matching on name or
  by consulting `Source` before `Id`; it would require inventing an identity NAG never had, and the
  alternative is silent clobbering.

**Kind safety (both trees)** — a payload-carrying leaf may only update an existing leaf, and a folder
wrapper may only merge into an existing folder (`MatchesReimportKind`). Node kind is defined by payload
presence (`TriggerNode.TriggerData`/`OverlayData`), there is no kind field. Without this, a folder
wrapper matching a same-named trigger would reach the overwrite branch with null data and erase it.

### Node ids when inserting

- Imported **triggers** always get a store-generated id, whatever the payload contains.
- An imported **overlay** keeps its exported `_id` only while that id is free in the collection; if it
  is taken (importing the same share into a second place — routine) a new id is generated instead.
  `_id` is unique across the whole collection, so trusting an exported id would throw and roll back the
  entire import. This is silent on purpose: it is expected behaviour, not an error (see
  CodingStandards → Logging).

### Threading in the share pipeline

- A share download must never block the dispatcher. Either be genuinely async
  (`TriggerUtil.RunQuickShareTaskAsync` uses `GetAsync`/`ReadAsStreamAsync`/`CopyToAsync`) or make sure
  the continuation resumes off the caller's context (`GinaUtil.RunGinaTaskAsync` uses
  `ConfigureAwait(false)` because its chunk loop is synchronous). The entry points are click handlers,
  so a naive `await` captures the WPF context and resumes the whole transfer on the UI thread.
- Core must not touch WPF. Dialogs and messages go through host hooks (`GinaPlatform`,
  `TriggerStorePlatform`) that marshal to the UI thread; `App.xaml.cs` wires them at startup. The Core
  defaults are no-ops / fail-open so a host that forgets a hook degrades instead of throwing — which
  means **a new hook must be wired in `App.xaml.cs` in the same change**, or it silently does nothing.

### Media validation, badges and fixups during import

- Icon, sound-file and sprite validation runs through `TriggerStorePlatform` hooks (see above).
- The missing-media result must **accumulate** (`hasMissingMedia |= CheckMissingMedia(…)`): the return
  value is what flags the containing folder, so assigning it lets a later clean sibling erase an earlier
  hit and the folder badge disappears.
- A trigger's `SelectedOverlays` references are filtered to overlays that exist in the tree
  (`ValidateOverlays`). Dangling references are dropped, never remapped — do not turn this into a "pick
  something similar" repair.
- `RecentlyMerged` and `MissingMedia` are in-memory session badges surfaced by the view builder and
  cleared from the *Clear Recently Merged* menu. Nothing persists them; don't rely on them across
  restarts, and don't use them as import bookkeeping.
- Imported overlays pass through `SetVerticalAlignment`, which repairs alignment stored by older
  versions at a hard-coded original resolution. That is why an imported overlay can move.

### Names and whitespace

LiteDB trims leading/trailing whitespace on stored strings. Every incoming name is trimmed before any
matching happens (`NormalizeName`), because the NAG dump contains padded names like `" Emollious
colours…"`, and an untrimmed name never matches its trimmed stored twin — each re-import would add a
duplicate instead of updating.

### Keep matching logic out of the store

`TriggerImportPlanner` is pure: it takes the target folder's siblings plus the `OriginalIds` that occur
more than once in the incoming batch and returns an `ImportDecision`; `TriggerStateDB.Import` applies it
to LiteDB. New trigger matching rules belong there, with unit tests under
`EQLogParser.Test/src/store`, so they are covered on any platform rather than only in a WPF session.

### Known warts, deliberately unfixed

Recorded so they are not mistaken for open bugs — each was reviewed and left alone:
- The overlay **Import**/**Export** tooltips mention "the Selected Folder" / "Selected Folders" although
  overlay import ignores the selection and always merges into the `Overlays` root. Text copied from the
  trigger menu; cosmetic.
- The generic walker in `TriggerStateDB.Import` will still create a directory node in the overlay tree
  if a hand-edited or foreign payload contains a node with neither payload type. EQLP's exporter cannot
  produce one, so nothing validates against it today.
- `GinaUtil` builds its SOAP envelope by concatenating the session id taken from the chat line, and sets
  `Content-Length` by hand to a character count. The GINA service is effectively offline, so this path
  fails fast; if it ever matters again, build the request with a real XML writer instead of appending.

### Decisions that were reconsidered and rejected

- Matching overlays by name (clobbers unrelated players' overlays).
- Consulting `Source` before `Id`, or always loading all siblings to find a `Source` match.
- Logging overlay id collisions, re-imports, or other expected outcomes of normal sharing.
- Adding folder-merge semantics to overlay import without a product decision.

## Speech synthesis and TTS engines

The audio subsystem can speak trigger callouts with one of three engines: the Windows speech API, Piper, or
Kokoro. One speaks at a time. Which one is a user setting (`TtsEngine`), applied at startup and switchable while the
app runs.

### One engine behind ITtsEngine

Each engine implements `ITtsEngine` (`EQLogParser.Audio/src`) and owns its own per player voice state. A factory walks
the configured preference (settings key `TtsEngine`, set from the TTS Engine item of the **Tools** dropdown on the
Triggers toolbar, alongside Dictionary and Quick Shares) and
falls back through the remaining engines in order - a Piper whose pack is missing or will not load reaches an installed
Kokoro before the Windows voices, which are the last resort and need no files at all - so a missing model or voice pack
is a silent downgrade rather than an error dialog. Engine names are matched case insensitively at every boundary
(`TtsEngineFactory.Normalize`) because the setting is plain text somebody can edit.

The session's first engine is built on the thread pool from the `AudioManager` constructor, not inline: a Kokoro
session over the 156 MB model graph takes seconds, and that constructor runs on the UI thread the moment startup
touches `Instance`. `LoadValidVoicesAsync` is the single point that waits for the build - startup awaits it before the
main window shows, players register only after it - so the engine field can be null only in that window.

Before this seam `AudioManager` carried `_usePiper` / `_useKokoro` booleans consulted at a dozen sites — voice listing,
default voice, per player voice binding, synthesis, sample rates, shutdown — and kept a synth object per engine inside
its player records. Every engine therefore touched every other engine's code, and none of it could be exercised
without the native library behind it.

### What a voice is called

`GetVoices()` hands out ids - `af_nicole`, `en_US-lessac-medium`, `Microsoft David Desktop` - and those exact strings are
what a character's config stores and what an engine is told to speak. The pickers show something shorter through
`ITtsEngine.GetVoiceDisplayName`, reached from the view layer by one converter (`VoiceNameConverter`) on the three voice
dropdowns, so the item itself stays the id: whatever saves, matches or speaks a voice never sees the label, and no stored
value changed.

Where the label comes from is each engine's business. Kokoro reads the accent straight out of its own naming convention,
`[locale][gender]_name`, which turns `af_nicole` into "Nicole (US)" and `bf_emma` into "Emma (GB)" - worth showing now
that the pack carries British voices too. Piper labels a voice with the locale its model declares in `language.code`
(`voices.json` may say so outright), settled once when the engine starts because it costs a small file read per voice;
a name that cannot be located goes without a suffix. Windows answers with the name it was handed: "Microsoft David
Desktop" needs no improvement, and the `(Legacy) ` marking on a System.Speech voice is information rather than noise.

A third form exists because one place says a voice's name out loud. Picking a row in a voice dropdown previews it by
speaking that name, so `ITtsEngine.GetVoiceSpokenName` returns the name with neither the identifier's leading letters nor
the locale tag — "Nicole" from `af_nicole`, "Cori" from a Piper pack whose display label reads "Cori (GB)". Handing the
stored value to a synthesizer instead spells it: Kokoro reads `af_heart` as letters, so choosing Heart was answered by
somebody reciting "ay eff heart".

### Synthesis threading and cache

`SpeakTtsAsync`, `TestSpeakTtsAsync`, `SpeakOrSaveTtsAsync` and `TestSpeakFileAsync` are fire-and-forget for their
callers, so they hand the work to the thread pool and never resume on the caller's context. Synthesis happens inside
the engine behind `Task.Run`, because ONNX Runtime and SAPI block: a Kokoro sentence costs a few hundred milliseconds
and used to run on the UI thread, freezing the window mid callout. One `SemaphoreSlim` still serializes synthesis —
the neural engines are CPU-bound and overlapping calls only slow every caller down.

Synthesized PCM is cached in the same memory cache used for audio files, keyed by engine, voice and a hash of the text
(60 minute sliding expiry, sized in bytes so the existing 100 MB budget accounts for it). A line like `Got the level
90` plays dozens of times a raid, so only the first occurrence pays for inference. The text is hashed rather than used
verbatim so a long custom callout cannot produce an unbounded key.

A cached phrase needs neither the gate nor an engine: those bytes belong to an engine, a voice and a text, not to
whichever engine happens to be speaking, so the first lookup answers from the cache alone. That is what keeps twenty
familiar callouts from queueing behind one new sentence being synthesized. Everything that can miss runs under the gate,
where the engine cannot change underneath it.

Synthesis is not the only thing that touches an engine, and the gate alone was not enough: `SetVoice`, `RemoveVoice`,
`GetVoices` and `GetVoice` are called by the UI, synchronously, and one of them arriving while a switch releases an
engine's native state is a use-after-free in Piper's voice table rather than a caught exception. They now run under a
separate `_engineLock`, which the swap and the retirement also take. It is deliberately not held across synthesis — a
callout must never wait behind a dropdown, and a dropdown must never wait behind a model.

### Switching engines while running

`AudioManager.SwitchEngineAsync` builds the requested engine, lets it discover its voices, re-binds every player, swaps
it in, disposes the one it replaced, and then warms the voices that are still bound. The **TTS Engine** dialog calls it
when you press **Use**, and after a runtime pack finishes downloading, so switching takes effect on the next callout
instead of on the next start. The saved
setting still decides what a fresh launch uses, and a switch that cannot be honored (model missing, native library
refusing to load) leaves the current engine speaking rather than leaving the app without speech.

Two things make swapping safe rather than merely convenient:

- The whole switch runs under the synthesis `SemaphoreSlim`, so an engine is created and destroyed while nothing can be
  speaking through it. Synthesis re-reads `_tts` *after* acquiring that gate, which is why a callout that arrives mid
  switch cannot end up using a retired engine, nor cache PCM under the wrong engine's key. The swap itself and the
  disposal of the retired engine additionally run under `_engineLock`, so the quick UI-side engine calls described above
  cannot straddle them either. An engine that was built but never became active is disposed at the same point, which is
  why a switch that fails part way through does not leak a 300 MB inference session.
- Warm-up happens *after* the switch returns the gate, never inside it. Warm-up enters that gate only when it is free,
  so asking from a method that already holds it means every warm-up after a switch quietly gives up.
- A voice name from one engine means nothing to another, so `AudioManager` remembers what the host asked each player
  to speak with (`_requestedVoices`) and replays those names to the new engine. The engine binds the names it has and
  drops the rest, which sends that player back to the engine's default voice. Kokoro deliberately refuses to remember
  a name it does not have: a stale name would otherwise cling to a player for the rest of its life and be spoken
  quietly as a different voice.

### Warming a voice before anything has to wait on it

Speaking costs time in three separate places, and only some of it is the model: building a Piper voice is an ONNX
session over the voice model plus the espeak-ng dictionaries; *any* engine's first synthesis warms the runtime behind it
(arena sizing, kernel selection, the phonemizer's tables); and the audio device opens lazily on first playback. Cached
phrases skip all of it, so a trigger that says the same dozen sentences pays once per session — the delay is on the
first thing said with a voice, which is usually the trigger someone is waiting for.

`AudioManager.WarmUpVoice` covers the parts that can be paid in advance:

- **When:** a player is registered (`Add`), its voice changes (`SetVoice` — this is what the voice dropdown does, both
  when you pick one and when an engine switch repopulates the list and selects a default) and after an engine switch,
  for each distinct voice still bound to a player.
- **What:** `ITtsEngine.WarmUpVoiceAsync`. Piper builds the native voice; Kokoro and Windows have nothing per voice to
  build — every embedding arrives with the session made at engine creation — so they speak one short word into memory
  and throw it away, which is what warms inference.
- **Never audible and never in the way:** warm-up enters the synthesis gate only when it is free, retries briefly if
  something is talking, and gives up rather than standing in line. Choosing a voice also speaks an audible preview, and
  waiting behind a warm-up for that would be worse than staying cold. Whatever the retry window misses costs speed and
  nothing else.
- **One worker, one voice at a time:** requests queue rather than each starting a task of its own, deduped by engine and
  voice, because registering thirty characters at a zone-in is thirty voices asking for CPU at the same moment. A voice
  counts as prepared only when it actually got through; recording one that gave up would suppress the next attempt and
  leave a player cold for the rest of the evening.

Piper holds **one** prepared voice outside the players, under a reserved id in the native table. Previews used to build
a voice, speak and destroy it, so every different text paid for the model again; now `ResolveAdHocSpeaker` keeps it,
and takes the previous one out when the selection moves — which is the whole point, since otherwise an afternoon of
trying voices leaks a hundred megabyte model per change. Two further rules keep memory flat: a preview of a voice that
some player already speaks uses *that player's* session rather than building a second copy, and rebinding a player to a
different voice removes the old native voice first, because replacing a table entry is not documented as releasing it.

### Windows voices are proven, not assumed

Windows is the only engine with no files to check: the voices live in the operating system, so "is it available?" has no
answer short of asking one to speak. Historically the code answered *yes* unconditionally and swallowed whatever came
back, which reads as silence with nothing in the log.

Now `LoadVoicesAsync` records the verdict (`WindowsTtsEngine.IsAvailable`) and everything downstream — engine choice at
startup, what the picker lets you click, whether a switch is honored — reads it:

- **Wine is answered before anything has to fail.** `ntdll.dll` exports `wine_get_version` and real Windows never has,
  so asking for that export is not a heuristic about build numbers or registry keys a service pack can move. The check
  is worth its cost because the two errors are not equally bad: wrongly concluding "this is Wine" switches off the only
  engine a machine has, while a wrong answer in the other direction just leaves the runtime probe below to catch it.
  Loading `ntdll.dll` pinned to System32 keeps that from being spoofable by a planted copy next to the executable, and
  the result is cached. Whisky, Bottles and CrossOver are all Wine underneath and land here too; a real Windows install
  in a VM on Linux keeps its voices, which is the correct answer.
- **Unknown counts as available.** The probe only runs for the engine that actually starts, so an unprobed engine must
  not be hidden. This is the last engine standing; hiding it on a guess would silence someone who is fine.
- **False from the runtime probe means both APIs came back empty.** WinRT `SpeechSynthesizer` and legacy SAPI are
  checked independently and either one is enough: a machine with only legacy voices installed stays available. Windows
  images with the speech runtime removed produce nothing from both, which is the case this catches that Wine does not.
- **An engine with no voices is not a switch target.** `SwitchEngineAsync` asks the new engine for its voice list after
  `LoadVoicesAsync` and refuses it if empty, staying on the current engine instead of reporting a successful switch
  into silence.
- If nothing at startup turns out to be usable, `LoadValidVoicesAsync` logs it. That line is the difference between a
  bug report saying "no audio" and one that says what to fix.
- **What this engine holds per player is two synthesizer objects, not a lock.** `_lock` covers the player table only;
  nothing in this class serializes an utterance, on either API. Concurrency belongs to `AudioManager`, which lets one
  synthesis run at a time across all engines — worth knowing before adding a second gate here, and before assuming a
  second callout can be synthesized concurrently through `System.Speech`, which it cannot.

The picker greys an engine out only when there is neither a way to use it nor a way to get it: Piper and Kokoro stay
clickable while not installed because clicking them is how they get downloaded, and Windows goes grey when it has been
caught having no voices. `GetEngineDescription` in the dialog says so in words too — the Windows voices come from the
OS, which is why a Wine or Linux session usually has none.

### What installs and what downloads

The installer carries the app plus two small assemblies that `EQLogParser.Audio.dll` is compiled against
(`KokoroSharp.dll`, `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.dll`) so the seam types resolve and an engine reports itself unavailable
rather than failing. Everything heavy is fetched into per-user storage on demand:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\EQLogParser\kokoro\   bin\ (MisakiSharp, NumSharp, OpenTK, Numerics.Tensors)
                                     native\ (onnxruntime.dll, providers_shared)
                                     voices\ (*.npy + LICENSE)
                                     model\kokoro-fp16.onnx
%LOCALAPPDATA%\EQLogParser\piper-tts\  piperApi.dll and friends, voices\, espeak-ng-data\
```

`LocalApplicationData`, not `ApplicationData`: the Roaming folder is copied at logon and logoff on profile-redirected
machines, and 230 MB of re-downloadable binaries is the worst possible thing to put on that path. EQLP's own state
(`config\`, `logs\`, `archive\`) stays in Roaming where it belongs — roam what the user made, download what we ship.
`TtsPackManager` owns those directories: it resolves them, downloads and verifies packs, and deletes them. Publish order
is fixed by one fact — signing rewrites a file's tail, so the SHA-256 manifest the app verifies has to be generated from
the signed bytes (`sign.cmd`, then manifest, then upload).

Nothing here needs to load at startup: .NET resolves assembly references on first use, which is what makes hosting the
engines remotely possible at all. Two hooks cover a pack once it exists:

- `AssemblyLoadContext.Default.Resolving` answers `MisakiSharp`, `NumSharp`, `OpenTK*` and `System.Numerics.Tensors`
  from `<kokoro>\bin`, using `Assembly.LoadFrom` on the default context rather than a private `AssemblyLoadContext`.
  A second copy of a shared dependency in another context would not bind to the KokoroSharp that installs beside the
  executable, and type identity across the seam matters more than isolation here.
- `ResolvingUnmanagedDll` answers `onnxruntime.dll` and its provider stub from `<kokoro>\native`, which is what
  `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime`'s own P/Invoke stubs ask for. Piper needs neither: its import resolver loads
  `piperApi.dll` by full path and the OS takes the dependencies sitting beside it.

Both return "not mine" (null / `IntPtr.Zero`) for anything they do not have, so unrelated loads are untouched.
The hooks are registered once, before any engine is constructed.

Neither hook is a guarantee, and that distinction turned out to matter: they are asked **after** the default search has
failed to find a name. `onnxruntime.dll` is a case where something else may answer first — see
[Which onnxruntime.dll wins](#which-onnxruntimedll-wins) — which is why the runtime is claimed rather than resolved.

There is no fallback to a copy beside the executable, and there deliberately is not one. Reading `{app}\piper-tts` when it
was complete -- which earlier releases did, so that upgrading did not cost a re-download -- meant an engine could be
running off files the dialog cannot update, cannot remove, and cannot match against a pinned digest, and worse: those
files are still sitting in old build outputs, so development runs reported a working Piper nobody had downloaded. One
location per engine, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EQLogParser\<engine>`, owned end to end by `TtsPackManager`. `[InstallDelete]` now
deletes what installs before packs left under `{app}`; the files are inert whether or not they are removed, so that entry
is about reclaiming space, not about behavior.

### Downloading a pack, and getting out of one

An install is four jobs wearing one progress bar, and the bar is divided the way the work is: nine tenths for bytes off
the network, then slices for hashing the archive, unpacking it, and checking every extracted file against
`manifest.json`. Nothing sits at 90 % for a minute while the app works, which is the part people could not otherwise
distinguish from a freeze — reading a few hundred megabytes back takes tens of seconds after a fast download.

Every one of those loops watches the Cancel button through one `CancellationToken`: the transfer, the archive digest,
each extracted entry, each verified file. `ZipArchiveEntry.ExtractToFile` is deliberately not used, because it neither
reports bytes nor aborts before an entry finishes and one entry here is the 156 MB model. Cancellation is worth this much
because of where the work happens: unpacking and verification run in `<engine>.staging`, an existing pack moves to
`<engine>.retired` only once the new copy is complete and verified, and a promotion that fails puts the old copy back.
Give up halfway and the only trace is a deleted temp archive; a pack that spoke this morning still speaks.

Two free-space checks guard the job rather than one. Room for the archive is checked before the download begins — that
check exists to save somebody's bandwidth, so it refuses only the case that cannot possibly work. Room for the extracted
tree is checked afterwards from the zip's own central directory, which states the uncompressed size of every entry, so it
is a measured number rather than a guessed compression ratio and it fires before files start landing. An unreadable drive
or an unmeasurable archive counts as room enough in both: this is not the place where a disk gets argued with, and a
disk that fills up anyway reports the real figure itself.

### Kokoro model integrity

The Kokoro graph (156 MB) is not part of the installer. It arrives over HTTPS inside the Kokoro runtime pack the first
time a user opts in, which means the file the app later executes with its own privileges came off the network rather
than out of a signed package.

- `TtsPackManager` pins the SHA-256 of the archive and verifies every file in it against the pack's `manifest.json`
  before promoting it into place, and `KokoroTtsEngine` independently pins the graph itself
  (`ModelSha256`) and re-checks it before handing the path to onnxruntime. Two independent pins: a pack that was
  built wrong, or changed after install, still does not get to run.
- A verified model gets a `kokoro-fp16.onnx.sha256` marker beside it, so the hash pass costs nothing at every
  start. A hand-placed or previously downloaded model pays for it once, then writes the marker.
- We do not delete a model that fails verification, and we do not re-hash on every load: a mismatch is reported in
  the log once, the engine reports itself unavailable, and the existing fallback chain picks up. Deleting a user's
  156 MB download over a checksum we could have mispinned is the worse failure.
- Changing `ModelFileName` (for example back to the fp32 graph) means updating `ModelSha256` in the same commit.
  The two constants are the pin.

### Piper native lookup

`piperApi.dll` lives in the Piper runtime pack (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\EQLogParser\piper-tts`) and nowhere else, so it needs a
search path of its own. The
first implementation called `SetDllDirectory`, which is process-global and single-slot: it applied to every later
native load by anyone in the process, silently replaced any other caller's directory, and was the cause of a real
bug where listing Windows voices initialized Piper as a side effect.

`PiperTtsEngine` now registers a `NativeLibrary` import resolver that answers exactly one library name, `piperApi.dll`,
from whichever pack directory is in play (the engine's own copy is captured when it is built, so downloading a pack
while an older Piper is alive cannot move files out from under it — and `initialize()` re-runs against the new
espeak-ng data when the directory changes). Everything else returns `IntPtr.Zero` and resolves normally. Piper's own
dependencies (`onnxruntime.dll`, `espeak-ng.dll`, `piper_phonemize.dll`) sit beside `piperApi.dll`, which the altered
search path used by `NativeLibrary.Load` covers.

### Which onnxruntime.dll wins

Both speech engines load `onnxruntime.dll`, and Windows keeps **one native module per base name** for the life of a
process: whoever maps it first holds that name, and every later request — an import from `piperApi.dll`, a P/Invoke from
`Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.dll`, even a load by absolute path to a different file — is answered out of the module list.
So one ONNX Runtime serves the whole session, and the question is which file that is.

The answer cannot be left to resolution order, because an old copy is easy to hit. `onnxruntime.dll` is not a Windows
system DLL, but other programs install it there anyway: a machine with a 2021-vintage `C:\Windows\System32\
onnxruntime.dll` (1.7.x) answers `DllImport("onnxruntime")` from System32 and refuses Kokoro's graph with something like
"Unsupported model IR version" about a download that is perfectly fine. Two facts make that fatal rather than merely
untidy:

- The default search — the host's deps.json native assets, then `LoadLibraryEx` over the usual directories including
  System32 — runs **before** .NET asks anyone's resolver. A search that *succeeds* with somebody else's file never asks
  `ResolvingUnmanagedDll`, and a resolver registered for `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` never runs either.
- `EQLogParser.deps.json` lists `runtimes/win-x64/native/onnxruntime.dll`, which the installer deliberately does not
  ship (that is ~12 MB of a ~20 MB installer, and the packs carry it). A declared native asset that is not on disk is
  simply not found, so a clean install falls through to the operating system while a development run — whose build
  output does have the file — resolves it correctly. That asymmetry is why this bug showed up on a VM and not on the
  machine that reproduced everything else.

What works instead is being **resident first**, which is `TtsPackManager.PreferMatchingOnnxRuntime()`: it loads EQLP's
own copy by absolute path, so from then on every request for the name is answered with ours. Candidate order is
`<kokoro>\native`, then `<piper-tts>`: Kokoro's copy leads because it is published together with the managed wrapper
installed beside the executable and repacked whenever that wrapper moves, while Piper's pack carries the same build today
and either serves. It runs once, from the thread pool, before the session's first engine is built (`AudioManager`) — not
from the constructor, because mapping a 12 MB runtime is not startup work for the UI thread — and again from both engines
for a pack downloaded mid-session. Whichever engine gets there first is fine; that is the point of keeping the choice in
one place rather than in an engine.

Three supports around the claim, each covering a case the others cannot:

- `EnsureOnnxRuntimeImportResolver` pins `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime`'s own imports to the approved folder. It cannot beat
  System32 — nothing registered from managed code can, once the default search finds a file — so its job is the mirror
  failure: when EQLP's copy is **missing** it throws instead of returning `IntPtr.Zero`, because handing the name back
  is exactly how a foreign runtime gets in. Fail loudly on a decision we own.
- After claiming, `IsForeignOnnxRuntimeResident()` asks which file is actually mapped — an absolute-path load returns the
  already-resident module, so success alone does not prove it is ours — and Kokoro refuses to start when the answer is a
  path outside its packs and program folder. The alternative is 156 MB of "re-download your model" advice aimed at a
  file that is fine.
- `WarnOnRuntimeDrift` compares the mapped module's version with the wrapper installed beside the executable, since the
  pack publishes the two together and a mismatch means one of them moved alone. Warn, not refuse: major.minor is not the
  whole contract and an engine that speaks beats a tidy log.

### The MSVC runtime the same way

`onnxruntime.dll` imports `msvcp140.dll`, `msvcp140_1.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll` and `vcruntime140_1.dll`. Those four
install app-local beside `EQLogParser.exe` (`EQLogParser\redist`, Microsoft-signed and left that way) so a machine with no
Visual C++ redistributable can still speak — historically that was exactly where Kokoro failed on Wine while Piper worked,
and the difference was never the ONNX build.

They are claimed by name in the same call, before ONNX Runtime is mapped, and that claim is the load-bearing part. A
runtime loaded from `<kokoro>\native` is mapped with an altered search path — its own directory, then the system
Directories — so the program folder is **not** in that list, and four DLLs beside `EQLogParser.exe` would do nothing for
it unless those names were already resident. Claiming them first means ONNX's imports are answered from the module list,
which is also why the claim runs before the runtime and not after.

The consequence of installing them flat in `{app}` is worth stating plainly: the search order puts the program folder
ahead of System32, so these four are what this process maps even on a machine that has a newer redistributable. That is
Microsoft's *local deployment* of the CRT and it holds under one condition — **the checked-in copies stay current**
(`EQLogParser\redist\README.md` says how to refresh them). The CRT serves older binaries forward, so an up-to-date
app-local copy is a safe floor for everything in the process: Syncfusion's natives, NAudio's, ONNX Runtime's. Which file
answered each name is visible twice over — in `scripts\MeasureLoadedAssemblies.ps1` output, and in the Debug lines
`ClaimVisualCppRuntimes` writes.

Whether that makes Bottles' `vcredist2022` dependency redundant is a separate question with a fresh-prefix test in front
of it (`bottles/Games/eqlogparser.yml` keeps it until someone runs one).

## Floating Combat Text

`Tools → FCT Overlay` shows the player's own combat numbers from live log records. The rendering choice is
settled and recorded in `docs/NagFctReference.md` (SkiaSharp beat the WPF vector path ~100 fps vs ~30 fps at
×10 raid scale); this section covers why the *plumbing* is shaped the way it is, because that is the part a
later change is most likely to undo by accident.

### One queue, drained on the render tick

`FctManager` does not raise an event per record. It pushes `FctHitCommand`s onto a `ConcurrentQueue` and the
overlay drains it from the canvas's `EventsFrame` callback — once per painted frame, at most 60 times a second.

The earlier shape posted one dispatcher item per record, which is the worst of both worlds: a raid AoE window
of ~200 hits/s became 200 cross-thread posts and 200 layout invalidations, and a UI stall replayed the whole
burst seconds after it stopped mattering. Draining on the frame clock batches for free (the frame is the batch)
and makes staleness cheap to reason about: anything older than `FctManager.MaxQueueAgeMs` is dropped and counted
rather than drawn. A combat number that arrives half a second late describes a swing the player has already
reacted to; showing it is worse than losing it, because it lies about what is on global right now.

Two counters make overload visible instead of mysterious: `FctManager.DroppedCount` (queue lost the UI could not
draw) and `IFctDiagnostics.DroppedCount` on the canvas (hits the lane caps refused). The header shows their sum
as "N dropped" only when it is non-zero, so a healthy overlay stays quiet.

### Parsing costs nothing when nobody is looking

`FctManager.Enabled` is a volatile flag gated at the top of both handlers, and it is set from the overlay's
`IsVisibleChanged`. Hiding the overlay therefore stops the feed at the parser: no player-name comparisons, no
pet-owner registry lookups, no command allocation. `DamageLineParser`/`HealingLineParser` additionally hoist
their static event delegate before raising, so with no subscriber even the `*ProcessedEvent` wrapper is not
allocated — FCT is the only reason those events exist, and it should not tax a user who never opens it.

A window owns exactly one manager: `FctManager.Create()` on construction, `Dispose()` (which unsubscribes from
both parsers) on close. Without that pairing a closed overlay keeps a live handler chain feeding a queue nobody
drains, which is invisible until the next session shows yesterday's fight.

### Shared policy, per-backend drawing

The two canvases used to carry near-copies of the same layout and motion code, and they drifted within days. Now
`FctHitState` is plain data and the decisions live in one place:

- `FctIngest` — fold into a live number, spawn, or drop at the lane cap.
- `FctLayout` — which region of the canvas a lane lives in (bands or halves), spawn position, travel, the protected middle.
- `FctMotion` — position, scale, opacity and **the text itself** as pure functions of `(hit, age)`.
- `FctStyle` — lane → font size/color as `0xAARRGGBB` ints, so neither backend owns a palette copy.
- `FctLifeController` / `FctMedianTracker` — adaptive lifetime and the rolling median.

A backend keeps only what genuinely differs: substrate resources (Skia `SKFont`/`SKPaint`/halo sprites, WPF
`FormattedText`/brushes) and its draw loop. That split is also what makes the animation unit-testable
(`EQLogParser.Wpf.Test/src/ui/control/Fct*Test.cs`) without a window, dispatcher or GPU — worth keeping in mind
before moving maths back into a canvas.

`FctMotion.RefreshText` having the text rule is deliberate and fixes a real bug: zero-damage records (Dodge,
Parry, Invulnerable) carry `Value == 0`, and a renderer that recomputed the numeric string each frame overwrote
the label with "0" — which reads as a legal absorb rather than an obvious mistake. A hit with `FixedText` set now
can only ever draw that text.

### Raster at most 60 times a second, and never on a beat pattern

`CompositionTarget.Rendering` fires at display refresh, so on a 144 Hz monitor an animated canvas would raster a
full surface 144 times a second for text nobody can read faster. The cap lives in `FctFramePacer` (shared by both
backends, since both are driven by the same callback); the tick still fires `EventsFrame` (the simulation paces its
record schedule off it) but the surface memset + draw + blit does not run. On a 980×640 overlay at 150% scaling, each
skipped raster is ~3.5 MB of pixel work avoided.

**The cap counts whole ticks, and that detail is the difference between smooth and juddery.** The first version asked
"has `TargetFrameMs` (16.67 ms) elapsed since the last paint?" — a threshold tuned to 60 Hz sitting on top of a 60 Hz
stream. Real frames arrive at 16.4, 16.9, 16.6…; whenever one lands a hair early it is skipped, the next frame is two
refreshes later, and the cadence settles into an alternating one-frame/two-frames pattern. Positions are exact and the
average fps looks perfect while the text visibly stutters, most on the display where the cap is not skipping at all in
principle. `FctFramePacer` measures the refresh interval from the tick spacing itself (light EWMA, samples outside
0.5–200 ms discarded so a tab-out or a GC pause cannot retune it) and then paints on a whole number of ticks nearest
the target ratio: every tick at 60 Hz, every second at 120 Hz, every second at 144 Hz (72 fps, not the 48 that a time
threshold produced), every fourth at 240 Hz. Never faster than the display, never a beat pattern, and it re-derives
itself when the window moves to another monitor mid-fight.

Because smoothness lives in the tail and not the mean, `IFctDiagnostics` reports `MaxFrameMs` (worst frame in the stats
window) alongside the average, plus `DisplayHz` so painted fps can be read against the real refresh rate: 72 fps under a
144 Hz display is pacing, 60 fps under a 60 Hz display with a 40 ms max frame is overload. The simulation window prints
both; the gameplay overlay deliberately does not, because a stats line that moves every second is a distraction in a pull.
`FctFramePacerTest` feeds synthetic tick streams — including a jittered 60 Hz one, where it asserts the old time-threshold
rule really did skip frames — so the cadence is pinned without a monitor.

The destination bitmap and its copy buffer are allocated once per size and reused. Allocating a `WriteableBitmap`
plus a fresh `byte[w*h*4]` every frame put ~5 MB/frame on the large-object heap and forced a new GPU texture
upload each time instead of updating the existing one; both are now per-resize, not per-frame. The surface is
explicitly `Bgra8888`/`Premul`, byte-identical to WPF's `Bgra32`, so `ReadPixels` is a memcpy with no conversion —
and it fails closed (skip the frame) rather than blitting wrong bytes if Skia ever hands back another format.

The remaining copy (surface → snapshot → pinned array → back buffer) is the known next step: `D3DImage` with a
shared Skia surface would remove it. It is not taken here because it needs a real GPU to validate against, and
three memcpys are not what limits this renderer today.

### Two region schemes, and why direction went vertical

The overlay cannot know where the player's target ring, cast bar or spell gems sit in the game window, so it can only
promise that a band across its middle stays clear. The first scheme spent that promise horizontally: incoming lanes
on the left half, outgoing on the right, `FctLayout.CenterClearance` reserving the column between them and
`FctMotion.ArcedX` clamping with half the *scaled* text width so even a crit at full blowout cannot slide over the
middle. It worked for numbers and failed for everything else — left/right is a convention that has to be learned and
remembered, and it has no analogue anywhere in EQ's own UI.

`FctLayoutMode.Bands` (the default) makes direction vertical, which is how nearly every game with floating text does
it: text about my target rises out of the top of the overlay, text about my body sinks out of the bottom, and both
travel *away* from the protected strip between them (`GapTopFrac`/`GapBottomFrac`). Three things came out of that for
free:

- The empty middle is empty **by construction** rather than by clamping traffic out of it. Diverging travel cannot
  cross the gap it started outside, where the old scheme needed a per-frame clamp to keep two opposing fountains apart.
- Direction has two independent carriers (band and direction of motion) instead of one, so it survives a glance,
  peripheral vision and a colorblind player.
- The x axis stopped meaning *who* and went back to meaning *what*: damage sits toward the middle of its band,
  healing out wide, crits and labels centered. Each band carries two categories, so lane slots are still needed —
  they were never the problem; overloading one axis with two meanings was.

`FctLayoutMode.Halves` stays as a fallback behind the overlay header's "halves" checkbox (`FctOverlayLayout` in
settings.ini) for a player whose camera or HUD makes the vertical axis worse. It is the old geometry unchanged,
including the left/right rule and no vertical clamp — `FctMotion` treats an unset y band (`BandMaxY <= BandMinY`) as
"no vertical clamp" rather than pinning every hit to y=0, which is why halves stayed a 20-line branch instead of a
second code path. The overlay's hint line states which scheme is active and what it means, because that line is the
only documentation anyone reads while fighting.

A fountain's choreography — travel, then accelerate under gravity while shrinking — points *down* on its way out, and an
incoming band is the last thing before the bottom of the screen. A literal fall there parks the number against its own
band edge for half its life, which reads as stuck rather than as physics, so `FctIngest.AssignLifetime` **mirrors** it:
`FallDist` is signed screen-relative (positive falls toward the bottom, negative back up toward the gap) and an incoming
hit in bands mode gets half its sink distance back on the way out. Both sides then have the same overshoot-and-settle
shape in opposite signs, which is what "one animation, two directions" was supposed to mean, and the return cannot reach
the protected strip because it is a fraction of travel already spent below it. Halves mode has no such band and falls
everywhere, as it always did.

Both schemes keep their promises at any window size. In halves mode the x clamp degrades to the middle of its band
instead of throwing when a label is wider than its half — an inverted band used to crash every frame on a small
overlay — and bands mode falls back to "inside the edges" when a window is short enough to invert its y band.
`FctLayoutTest` pins all of it at 100–240 px, across the whole motion and at crit scale.

### Four motion styles, and the one thing none of them may change

The fountain began as a checkbox, which was honest while there were two choices and became a lie as soon as players
wanted text that stays put or fans out. `FctMotionStyle` is that axis now: **hold** (travel away from the strip, stop,
be read, fade — the default), **fountain** (overshoot, then fall; mirrored upward on the lower band), **pulse** (no
travel at all — it swells where it appeared) and **spray** (a random cone out of the lane slot, then a short fall).
Placement (`FctLayoutMode`), motion style and stacking are three orthogonal decisions, and cramming two of them into
one boolean was how "fountain" came to mean several things at once.

Three rules keep four styles from becoming four behaviours:

- **Motion is presentation, never information.** Band and direction of travel still say who acted whichever style is
  running, which is what makes "try each during the next pull" a safe thing to offer. The combo therefore applies to
  hits spawned *after* the change rather than restyling what is already on screen.
- **A hit keeps the style it was born with** (`FctHitState.Style`, snapshotted by `FctIngest.Accept`). If the renderer
  read one live setting, switching fountain → hold mid-flight would hand every parabola in progress a different
  velocity for its remaining frames. Snapshotting an enum per hit is what makes switching free.
- **The protected strip stays clear by construction, for all four.** Pulse's cells are laid out inside a margin off the
  strip's edge and every one is measured against it (`FctCellGrid`); spray falls
  back by a fixed share of the distance it already travelled (`SprayFallFrac`), mirrored upward on the lower band; hold
  never passes its clamp. Outgoing fountain is the one that still falls a share of *window* height — legitimate, since
  the strip is behind it and the bottom edge is clamped. A test sweeps each style across its whole curve asserting none
  enters the strip or leaves the window, so a future fifth style has to pass the same bar.

Spray needed one constant that measurement forced: `SprayReachFactor`, roughly twice the depth of a band, with height
capped at what the band offers. Given only the band's own travel budget (`usable * sin(theta)`), spray's horizontal
coverage came out **identical to hold's** — hold already adds 12% of width in arc plus a lane-slot jitter, so a shallow
cone sat entirely inside noise that was already there. A reach longer than the band lets the wide angles of the cone
actually move sideways while the steep ones simply top out against the clamp.

Widening the cone then exposed the real reason spray and fountain looked alike: **both axes ran on one ease curve**. When x
and y advance by the same fraction of their totals, every trajectory is a straight line from origin to apex — the fan
existed only in where numbers ended up, never in how they got there, so mid-flight a wide spray was a slanted fountain.
`FctMotion.LateralProgress` puts spray's sideways travel on an ease-out while its vertical keeps the smootherstep climb:
shrapnel keeps moving sideways while gravity handles the vertical, so the path bends over into an arc by itself. It eases
to zero slope at the apex instead of running linearly because a number that stops dead sideways at the moment it begins to
fall has a kink you can see. Hold and fountain deliberately keep one curve between them — a straight climb is what a thing
with no gravity does. A test pins the difference rather than trusting the eye: hold's drawn point never leaves the line
between its origin and its apex, spray's must leave it by more than 20 px and be nearly spread out by the time it peaks.

Two smaller changes went the same way. The cone opened from ±38° to ±49°, with `SprayMaxLateralFrac` moving from 0.30 to
0.34 of width — that cap has to travel with the angle or every wide draw stops at the same wall and the fan comes out flat
topped — and spray's choreography got its own tempo, `SprayMotionWindowMs` (1700 ms against fountain's 2000), because
shared flight time was the other half of the resemblance: two 2 second arcs read as one effect whatever path they draw, and
shrapnel is supposed to look quick. Measured at 980×640 with these numbers, spray covers 519 px of x mid-flight where hold
covers 246 and fountain 242.

Pulse then failed for a different reason, which in-game use showed and no amount of reasoning about single numbers would
have: **static text overlaps**. Free-floating placement is fine for numbers that move, because each is only in a spot for a
moment; a number that stays is read for its whole life, and two of them sharing a place is mush. That is what pulse was,
because it inherited the lane-slot jitter designed for travelling text.

Every combat log UI lands on the same fix — slot allocation — so `FctCellGrid` does: one cell per hit, held for the hit's
life, oldest taken when the block fills. WoW's anti-stagger number mode spreads simultaneous values across fixed positions
with a row limit (and the scrolling-text addons went further into explicit grids), FFXIV stacks a capped number of rows in
one place, GW2 groups into fixed areas. Deterministic positions are the point: the player stops hunting for numbers.

- **Cells belong to a band, not a lane.** The scarce thing is space inside a band; separate pools per lane would put the
  damage block on top of the healing block, which is the bug. Colour says what a number is, position only has to say "not
  on top of another number".
- **The outer row belongs to procs**, smaller cells kept out of the block being read so item spam can never push into it.
  Outward means away from the protected strip on both sides, which also keeps the strip's neighbour free of the most
  frequent text on screen.
- **Rows fill nearest the strip first, centre-out within a row**, and every number starts from one point in the band and
  slides into its cell (`FctMotion.PulseSlideMs`, 220 ms; zero puts numbers straight into their cells for anyone who finds
  the slide busy). A burst therefore reads as one event expanding rather than several unrelated appearances.
- **A full block takes its oldest cell, but a crit is not up for grabs.** If everything left is a crit and the newcomer is
  smaller, the newcomer is dropped and counted. Losing a routine number beats erasing the biggest one on screen.
- **Geometry depends only on band and canvas size, never on the hit being placed.** This one is load-bearing, and the first
  version got it wrong: sizing each row from that hit's own text reserve made two numbers in the same row disagree about
  where the row was, and they landed on each other — the exact bug the grid exists to kill. Row slots are shared; only the
  centring inside a slot is per-hit. The cost is that a crit's pop can crowd a neighbour by a few pixels, which every grid
  layout pays: rows sized for the loudest possible number would halve how many numbers fit.
- **An overlay too small for a grid keeps its numbers.** `HasRoom` is checked first; when no row plus margins fits, the hit
  keeps the plain static placement `FctLayout` gave it instead of being dropped. Losing layout is fine, losing damage is not.

Halves mode has no grid: its protected axis is horizontal, and its single spawn row sits nowhere near the centre column.

Pulse is also the nearest thing here to the reduced-motion option the design document asks for: nothing translates, so
the information arrives without movement. It is not labelled that way yet — an explicit reduced-motion setting should
pick pulse and shorten lifetimes rather than invent a fifth style.

What was deliberately **not** built is anchored-follow (a number tracking its own mob across the screen). EQ's log
never contains actor positions, only names, so there is nothing to anchor to; that absence is the whole reason the
design leans on bands and an empty strip instead of "numbers above your target".

### Colour answers "what", never "who"

`FctStyle` used to paint the successful-defence lane blue, which put direction on colour — and blue in particular
reads as mana, arcane damage or a friendly nameplate to anyone arriving from another MMO, so it was a wrong sign on
top of a redundant one. Nothing is blue now: yellow dealt / deep-orange crit / red taken / green heals, with crit's
hue pushed *deeper* than dealt damage rather than brighter (at 1.3× scale plus the pop, a light orange and the yellow
it must stand apart from converge). The zero-damage labels are hueless — pale slate for a defence that worked, one
step dimmer for my own whiff — with amber reserved for `Invulnerable`/`Absorb`, the two labels that mean "every cast
from here is wasted" and so deserve to beat the routine one next to them. The source line went neutral grey for the
same reason: it must not compete with a value colour for meaning.

Lane capacity is two-layered on purpose: `FctLifeController.Capacity` (5–7) is the *target* the adaptive lifetime
aims at, and `FctIngest`'s hard cap (12 per lane) is the backstop for burst windows. The backstop merges into a live
number before it drops anything, so overload compresses the display instead of eating damage. Merging has two modes:
below the cap only a *young* hit may absorb — pouring damage into a number that is already fading hides the amount —
while at the cap the newest hit takes it regardless of age, because "the label grows" is a much smaller lie than
"that hit never appeared". Crits refuse to absorb in both modes: a crit number that quietly inflates is misleading,
so crit overload is the case where `DroppedCount` actually moves. `FctIngestTest` pins both halves — 40 hits at one
lane still show 36,000 damage on screen with zero drops, and 20 crits into a capped crit lane report 8 counted drops.

Folding follows NAG's median idea with different numbers: `FctMedianTracker` keeps a rolling window per lane and
a direct hit below half the lane's median counts up on a live number instead of spawning its own (`periodic`
DoT/HoT ticks always fold — five overlapping 200s tell you nothing one running total does not). Healing never
folds: players read heals individually, and merging them hides who got patched. Half the median rather than
NAG's "ignore under 2× median of *max hits*" because ignoring is not an option here — losing a number in an
overlay whose whole job is to lose nothing measurable is worse than showing a small one.

### Text sizes, and the reserve they imply

The first pass used web-scale type, and every tier went up by at least two points once it was looked at how it is
actually read: across a game window, in peripheral vision, while moving (`FctStyle`: dealt 34 / taken 32 / healing 28 /
crit 40 / labels 24 / smallest numeric tier 23). The *ratios* were sound from the start, so treat an absolute size as a
presentation decision and a ratio as a design one.

Bigger type also made an existing bug impossible to miss: `FctHitState.Y0` is the **top** of the value text, and layouts
that reserved one em ran descenders and the entire source line off the bottom of the overlay — permanently, because
incoming hits travel downwards and spend their last seconds against the bottom edge. Every vertical bound now reserves
`FctLayout.TextReserve(hit)`: value height (`TextHeightFactor`), plus the source line's height when the hit carries one,
times `CritPeakScale` for a crit (the draw scales about a pivot partway down the value, so scaling the whole block
over-reserves slightly and never clips). It is a factor rather than measured glyph metrics for the same reason
`EstimateTextWidth` exists: bands are computed at spawn, before any backend has built text. `FctLayoutTest`
pins it in both region schemes, with a source line present and at crit scale.

### Procs are subordinate: a little smaller, and quicker

A proc is not the number anybody aimed at. Item and spell procs fire on their own schedule, several times a pull, and they
arrive on top of the swing or cast whose timing the player is reading - so at full lane size they compete with the hit
they accompany without being the reason for it. `FctStyle.ProcSizeFrac` (0.78) rides a proc's value below its lane, which
turns 34 into about 27: between dealt damage and a DoT tick, subordinate but not a footnote, with the source line shrinking
alongside it because a full-size ability name under a smaller number would undo the effect on its own.

Size alone does not separate two streams that land in the same place though, so procs also start in a different row of
their band: `FctLayout.ProcInsetFrac` (0.15) moves them further *out* from the protected strip — my procs higher up, procs
landing on me lower down — so the two occupy different rows of the same band and the eye can ignore one while reading the
other. Being a share of band depth it is clamped by the band ends, so a small overlay loses separation before it loses text;
a test stacks every combination on a 420×300 canvas to keep that true. Pulse mode does not need the inset: allocation gives
procs their own block of cells outright (`FctCellGrid`), which is a stronger version of the same rule.
`FctMotion.ProcTimeFrac` (0.7) then shortens the **whole** tempo rather than only its tail - travel, hold and fade
together - so a proc is gone shortly after the hit that provoked it instead of hanging there while that hit fades away.
A choreographed style scales as a unit for the same reason: shortening its life without its motion would run the parabola
in slow motion.

Neither reduction touches a crit proc, which is the one place where two independent "make it smaller" rules would have
stacked into a bug. A proc crit is the biggest single number in the log, and reducing both its size and its life would
have made the loudest event the quietest thing on screen - the opposite of what a pop is for. `FctStyle.ApplyTo` and
`FctIngest.ApplyProcTempo` each test `Blowout` for this, and a test asserts that a proc crit matches a plain crit in size,
life and motion, so the exemption cannot be lost by refactoring one of the two.

What makes this legitimate rather than a guess is that a proc is a **fact** about the record rather than an interpretation
of it: `DamageLineParser` assigns `Labels.Proc` by looking the spell up in `data/procs.txt` (EQ's own proc list, loaded in
`EQDataStore`), not from how a line happens to read. The flag travels on `FctHitCommand.Proc` because it cannot be
recovered downstream - by the time a canvas sees a hit it has a number, a lane and an ability name, none of which say why
the number exists. Same reason `Periodic` is carried as a flag instead of being guessed from a spell's name.

The simulation streams include a proc stream which reuses the ordinary spell names on purpose: the same word appearing at
two sizes side by side is what makes the treatment visible, rather than comparing a proc against some other ability.

### Smoothing, where animated text actually costs

- **Easing is smootherstep** (`6t⁵ − 15t⁴ + 10t³`) rather than ease-out-quad. Ease-out-quad leaves at full speed, which
  is what made a number look thrown onto the screen; smootherstep has zero velocity *and* zero acceleration at both
  ends, which is what "floated" means. The horizontal arc uses the same curve so the path cannot bend oddly mid-flight.
- **Skia's antialias flag defaults to off in SkiaSharp 3**, and every paint in `FctSkiaCanvas` draws glyphs or the
  blurred crit halo, so it is set explicitly: without it a 34 px number has staircase edges.
- **`SKFont.Hinting = None`, `SKFont.Subpixel = true`.** Hinting reshapes a glyph according to which pixel rows it lands
  on, so text that drifts a pixel per frame silently redraws its own outline every frame — the crawl people describe as
  jitter even though the position maths is continuous. Without subpixel positioning Skia snaps each run to a whole
  pixel, quantising exactly the motion `FctMotion` interpolated. Both settings are right for moving text and wrong for
  a static document, so they are commented rather than obvious: do not tidy them back to defaults.
- Pacing counts whole ticks instead of comparing elapsed time, for the reason given in "Raster at most 60 times a
  second": at exactly 60 Hz the old threshold skipped frames on ordinary jitter and produced an alternating cadence.
- **Both ends of the fade are eased.** A linear ramp changes slope abruptly at `fadeStart` — steady, then suddenly
  dimming, then gone — and a linear start is a pop. The trade is a slightly steeper mid-fade, which reads as the text
  holding up and then dissolving rather than draining away.
- **A counting-up total never moves anything else.** A folded DoT stack re-measures its glyphs each frame; letting the
  widening number also widen `ValueWidth` would widen the clamp band `ArcedX` reads, so the total drifted sideways as it
  climbed and looked unstable. `FctMotion.IsCountingUp` pins the backend to the widest measurement seen while counting.
- **The crit halo is shaped like the text it glows behind.** Its sprite is rendered with the same `Hinting = None` as
  the crisp pass; a hinted sprite under unhinted glyphs puts the bloom a fraction off the number.

### The one grammatical rule on the source line

`FctManager.DisplaySource` singularises the attack verb ("Crushes" → "Crush") for melee records **and** for the
zero-damage evade lines, because `DamageLineParser` fills `SubType` from `"X tries to crush Y, but Y dodges!"` even
though `Type` carries the label there. Miss that and the same swing reads "Crushes" beside DODGE and "Crush" under its
number — invisible in a log file, obvious in peripheral vision. Nothing else is ever conjugated: every other `SubType`
is a spell name, and proper nouns keep their letters (`Crown of Stars` is not `Crown of Star`).

### Locked by default: click-through and persistence

In game the overlay must not eat clicks or take focus, so `FctOverlayWindow` runs layered plus
`WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`/`WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` while locked — the same recipe as the timer, text and toolbar overlays: read
the extended styles with `NativeMethods.GetWindowLongPtr`, set or clear the bits, write them back with
`NativeMethods.SetWindowLong` through `GetWindowLongFields.GwlExstyle`. Transparency itself is declared once in XAML
(`AllowsTransparency`) and WPF does not rewrite those bits afterwards, so they are applied on `SourceInitialized`
and on each lock toggle instead of from a window hook — re-writing them per mouse message costs a syscall pair for
every hover over the overlay and buys nothing observable. Lock state and geometry persist through `ConfigUtil`
(`FctOverlayLeft/Top/Width/Height/Locked/Enabled`) and the overlay reopens at startup if it was open on exit. The two
presentation switches — region scheme (`FctOverlayLayout`) and motion style (`FctOverlayMotion`) — persist through
`FctOverlaySettings`, read by the overlay and by both simulation windows so a bands run and a halves run, or a hold run
and a spray run, differ in nothing but the thing being compared. `FctOverlayMotion` also reads the old
`FctOverlayFountain` boolean when its own key is absent: an upgrade should keep the choreography somebody had already
chosen instead of silently resetting them to hold, and because writes only ever use the new key the legacy entry fades
out on its own rather than needing a migration.

Because a locked window cannot be clicked, its own checkbox is unreachable by design; the way out is the Tools
menu's lock item, since locked also means `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` and therefore no keyboard input either — which is what
the overlay's hint line tells the user. (Esc still prefers unlock over close in the case where the window does hold
focus: losing a positioned overlay to a stray Esc is the worse failure.) `MainWindow` mirrors the state so menu and
checkbox never disagree, and unlocking from the menu calls `Activate()` so Esc and dragging are live afterwards.

`NativeMethods` exposes exactly two style vocabulary sets — `ExtendedWindowStyles` and `GetWindowLongFields` — and
neither has a `WS_EX_APPWINDOW` member nor a plain `GWL_STYLE` accessor. Overlay windows stay toolwindows in both
lock states, which is also what keeps them out of Alt+Tab; anything wanting app-window behavior has to add the
constant deliberately rather than assume it is there.

### What is deliberately not here yet

- Party-wide and other-players' heals: fed only when group configuration exists to scope them.
- Resist/immune as distinct event classes: the parser reports partial resists as reduced totals (which display
  correctly) and full immunity as `Labels.Invulnerable`; there is no "resisted 75%" record to show, so nothing is invented.
- Per-character or per-lane configuration, palette customization, and a reduced-motion mode. Colour is deliberately
  not load-bearing for reading the overlay — direction comes from region plus travel, and the two lanes that could
  be confused (my whiff vs a defence that worked) are also separated by size and band — so a palette switch is a
  comfort feature rather than an accessibility blocker.
- Real GPU presentation via `D3DImage` (see above).
