# EQLogParser Design Notes

Behaviour that is deliberate but not obvious from the code, and the rules that keep it that way.
Read the relevant section before changing import, sharing or migration code so decisions are not
quietly reversed. Style rules live in [CodingStandards.md](CodingStandards.md); this file answers
*"why is it like this?"* and *"what must not change without a decision?"*.

## Trigger and Overlay Import

"Import" means taking an `ExportTriggerNode` tree from some producer and merging it into the tree
stored by `TriggerStateDB`. The producers differ in transport and — importantly — in what identity
the payload carries:

| Producer | Wire form | Network | Identity carried by the payload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| File import `*.tgf.gz` (triggers) | gzip JSON `List<ExportTriggerNode>` | no | none |
| File import `*.ogf.gz` (overlays) | same | no | overlay leaves carry their EQLP `Id` |
| File import `*.gtp` | GINA file export: zip containing XML | no | none — **triggers only** |
| Quick Share `{EQLPT:key}` / `{EQLPO:key}` | key in an EQ chat line; payload fetched by key from the share host (`TriggerUtil.RunQuickShareTaskAsync`) | yes | same as the file exports |
| GINA share `{GINA:key}` | SOAP `DownloadPackageChunk`, up to 100 sequential chunks (`GinaUtil.RunGinaTaskAsync`) | yes | none — **triggers only** |
| NAG migration | local JSON chosen through the NAG directory picker | no | triggers: `OriginalId = nagTriggerId`; overlays: `OverlayData.Source = "nag:{overlayId}"` and **no Id** |

### The overlay tree is flat, the trigger tree is not

- Triggers live under the `Triggers` root, may contain folders, and are enabled per character.
- Overlays live under a single `Overlays` root as a **flat list**. Nothing in the product can create an
  overlay folder: the overlay context menu (`TriggersTreeView.xaml`) has no **Folder** command, and
  drag-and-drop refuses nesting for both trees (`ItemDropping` rejects `DropAsChild` unless the target
  `IsDir()`). The exporter therefore only ever writes overlay leaves directly under the root.
- Consequences to respect:
  - `ImportOverlays` always merges into the `Overlays` root, whatever was selected — the parent picked
    in the file dialog is used for triggers only.
  - Do not add folder-merge semantics, or features that assume grouping, to the overlay tree. Real
    grouping would need a product decision plus a data-model change and migration — not a patch in the
    import branch.
  - Overlays have no per-character enabled state: `ImportOverlays` passes no character ids, so nothing
    is written to `TriggerState.Enabled` for an overlay. Only triggers are enabled per character.

### Identity: what counts as "the same node" on re-import

This is the core contract of importing. Matching lives in `TriggerImportPlanner` (triggers) and in the
overlay branch of `TriggerStateDB.Import`.

**Triggers**
1. If the payload carries `OriginalId` (NAG), match on that. When more than one stored sibling — or
   more than one member of the incoming batch — shares the id, the family is disambiguated by `Name`,
   because one NAG trigger can expand into several siblings (phrase + timer variants, counter resets).
2. Otherwise match on `Name`.

`OriginalId` exists because NAG allows duplicate trigger names and the importer renames collisions
(`X` → `X (2)`), so name alone would break re-import and pile up duplicates. Trigger payloads carry no
node ids, so ids are never a trigger match key.

**Overlays — `Id` if present, `Source` only when there is no `Id`, never the name**
1. Match the sibling with the same EQLP `Id`.
2. If the payload has no `Id`, and `OverlayData.Source` is non-empty, match the sibling with that
   `Source`.
3. Otherwise insert a new overlay.

Rationale:
- The exporter writes `Id` only for overlay leaves, so `Id` is the only handle an EQLP→EQLP share or
  `.ogf.gz` file can offer, and it identifies content exactly. Checking it first is correct.
- `Source` is **not** a cross-user identity. NAG mints overlay ids as random 16-character nanoids per
  install, so `nag:{id}` values are only comparable within one person's own lineage. Its whole purpose
  is that re-running the NAG migration on the same install refreshes the overlays it created earlier
  instead of adding a second copy — which works precisely because NAG payloads carry no `Id`.
- Never match overlays by name. NAG's setup wizard creates overlays named things like *Detrimental
  Timers* and *Beneficial Timers*, so two players' same-named overlays are unrelated; a name match
  would silently overwrite someone else's work.
- On a `Source` match the stored overlay is also **renamed** to the incoming name, so content and name
  follow the latest migration. That is reachable only when no `Id` was supplied — i.e. NAG payloads —
  which is why it cannot clobber a shared overlay's local name.
- Accepted consequence: if one person migrates the same NAG database on two machines and then shares
  an overlay between them, they get one extra copy to delete. Do not "fix" this by matching on name or
  by consulting `Source` before `Id`; it would require inventing an identity NAG never had, and the
  alternative is silent clobbering.

**Kind safety (both trees)** — a payload-carrying leaf may only update an existing leaf, and a folder
wrapper may only merge into an existing folder (`MatchesReimportKind`). Node kind is defined by payload
presence (`TriggerNode.TriggerData`/`OverlayData`), there is no kind field. Without this, a folder
wrapper matching a same-named trigger would reach the overwrite branch with null data and erase it.

### Node ids when inserting

- Imported **triggers** always get a store-generated id, whatever the payload contains.
- An imported **overlay** keeps its exported `_id` only while that id is free in the collection; if it
  is taken (importing the same share into a second place — routine) a new id is generated instead.
  `_id` is unique across the whole collection, so trusting an exported id would throw and roll back the
  entire import. This is silent on purpose: it is expected behaviour, not an error (see
  CodingStandards → Logging).

### Threading in the share pipeline

- A share download must never block the dispatcher. Either be genuinely async
  (`TriggerUtil.RunQuickShareTaskAsync` uses `GetAsync`/`ReadAsStreamAsync`/`CopyToAsync`) or make sure
  the continuation resumes off the caller's context (`GinaUtil.RunGinaTaskAsync` uses
  `ConfigureAwait(false)` because its chunk loop is synchronous). The entry points are click handlers,
  so a naive `await` captures the WPF context and resumes the whole transfer on the UI thread.
- Core must not touch WPF. Dialogs and messages go through host hooks (`GinaPlatform`,
  `TriggerStorePlatform`) that marshal to the UI thread; `App.xaml.cs` wires them at startup. The Core
  defaults are no-ops / fail-open so a host that forgets a hook degrades instead of throwing — which
  means **a new hook must be wired in `App.xaml.cs` in the same change**, or it silently does nothing.

### Media validation, badges and fixups during import

- Icon, sound-file and sprite validation runs through `TriggerStorePlatform` hooks (see above).
- The missing-media result must **accumulate** (`hasMissingMedia |= CheckMissingMedia(…)`): the return
  value is what flags the containing folder, so assigning it lets a later clean sibling erase an earlier
  hit and the folder badge disappears.
- A trigger's `SelectedOverlays` references are filtered to overlays that exist in the tree
  (`ValidateOverlays`). Dangling references are dropped, never remapped — do not turn this into a "pick
  something similar" repair.
- `RecentlyMerged` and `MissingMedia` are in-memory session badges surfaced by the view builder and
  cleared from the *Clear Recently Merged* menu. Nothing persists them; don't rely on them across
  restarts, and don't use them as import bookkeeping.
- Imported overlays pass through `SetVerticalAlignment`, which repairs alignment stored by older
  versions at a hard-coded original resolution. That is why an imported overlay can move.

### Names and whitespace

LiteDB trims leading/trailing whitespace on stored strings. Every incoming name is trimmed before any
matching happens (`NormalizeName`), because the NAG dump contains padded names like `" Emollious
colours…"`, and an untrimmed name never matches its trimmed stored twin — each re-import would add a
duplicate instead of updating.

### Keep matching logic out of the store

`TriggerImportPlanner` is pure: it takes the target folder's siblings plus the `OriginalIds` that occur
more than once in the incoming batch and returns an `ImportDecision`; `TriggerStateDB.Import` applies it
to LiteDB. New trigger matching rules belong there, with unit tests under
`EQLogParser.Test/src/store`, so they are covered on any platform rather than only in a WPF session.

### Known warts, deliberately unfixed

Recorded so they are not mistaken for open bugs — each was reviewed and left alone:
- The overlay **Import**/**Export** tooltips mention "the Selected Folder" / "Selected Folders" although
  overlay import ignores the selection and always merges into the `Overlays` root. Text copied from the
  trigger menu; cosmetic.
- The generic walker in `TriggerStateDB.Import` will still create a directory node in the overlay tree
  if a hand-edited or foreign payload contains a node with neither payload type. EQLP's exporter cannot
  produce one, so nothing validates against it today.
- `GinaUtil` builds its SOAP envelope by concatenating the session id taken from the chat line, and sets
  `Content-Length` by hand to a character count. The GINA service is effectively offline, so this path
  fails fast; if it ever matters again, build the request with a real XML writer instead of appending.

### Decisions that were reconsidered and rejected

- Matching overlays by name (clobbers unrelated players' overlays).
- Consulting `Source` before `Id`, or always loading all siblings to find a `Source` match.
- Logging overlay id collisions, re-imports, or other expected outcomes of normal sharing.
- Adding folder-merge semantics to overlay import without a product decision.
